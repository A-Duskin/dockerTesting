<h3>Select a result to view<br>
The results should be viewed in order of Connectivity Graph, Network Graph, then Control Table<br>
The connectivity graph will show all vulnerabilities within your system that you have no protections from.
Understanding these vulnerabilities will improve understanding in the Network Graph.
The Network graph will show the possible paths of connected vulnerabilities of an adversary attack.
Knowing your systems weaknesses, the Control Table offers recommended mitigations to help secure your system.</h3>

        <h1>View Connectivity Graph</h1>
        <p>This graph shows the comprehensive connections of techniques and tactics available to the adversary in an attack.
        The more connected a tactic or technique are, the more they are able to be exploited.
        Due to the linearity of an attack path, some tactics may be unreachable from other tactics, this covers the disconnectivity of the graph.
        Lastly, this graph will also highlight the most prioritized tactic selected by the user or by the algorithm if left blank at upload.</p>

        <h1>View Attack Paths Graph</h1>
        <p>This graph expands on the previous connectivity graph and is able to show possible attack paths an adversary can use against your system.
        By reading the graph from source to sink, the techniques appear in order of possible ATT&CK tactics or stages in a cyber attack.
        The edges between tactics represents the adversary completing that technique and moving farther into the attack.

        <p>This table shows all information relevant for mitigations to better secure your system.
        Now that you have seen the vulnerabilities and implications within your system, this table will serve as a guide to secure it.
        It is recommended that you implement all controls related to your vulnerabilities for maximum protections.
